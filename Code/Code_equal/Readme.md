# Code descriptions

Arduino codes with Ton=Toff (on period of symbol = off period of symbol)

- VLC_8bit_MAE -> Manchester encoding with 8bit of data and XOR parity
- VLC_8bit_PWM2 -> PWM encoding with 8 bit of data and XOR parity
- VLC_8bit_PWM_2led -> PWM encoding with 2 data sources (can work independently)
